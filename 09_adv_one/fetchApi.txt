The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. 
It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as 
the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status.
You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument.

A fetch() promise only rejects when the request fails, 
for example, because of a badly-formed request URL or a network error. 
A fetch() promise does not reject if the server responds with HTTP status codes that indicate errors (404, 504, etc.). 
Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
